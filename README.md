When there are shifts in Industry demand each firms profit functions are affected by shifting the supply curve of each firm therefore increasing or decreasing profit. Therefore if there is an increase in sales it is assumed that industry demand shifts up therefore increasing the overall price of that product and vice versa.

## Conclusion

### Suppliers
For suppliers it is necessary to make sure that given the slow months of January, February, and April that the price of the item is still greater than average cost to make sure you will not incur negative returns during these slow months. It is also necessary to be know to reduce inventory during that time as well as increase inventory during the busy months of May - July as they are the highest sales months for both retail and warehouse.

### Buyers
For buyers it is good to know that since demand down during January, February, and April it is optimal to stock up on beer during this time to prepare for the busy retail months of June - July. Given Beer only lasts for around 4 - 6 months the best optimal time to stock up for December would be during the month of December as well since Wholesale sales are down during this time. This strategy gives Buyers the best optimal prices when purchasing in bulk.

## Wine

### Retail

### Buyers
For buyers it is good to know that since demand is down during January and February it is optimal to stock up on wine during this time to prepare for the busy retail months of November and December. However given that the difference between the slow months and the average months differs only slightly for warehouse sales it can still be optimal to purchase in bulk given the months of July and September since it is closer to the busy months of November and December. This strategy gives Buyers the best optimal prices when purchasing in bulk.
